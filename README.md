OS432
=====
This is a simple operating system designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (Model B). It was a class project for Advanced Operating Systems Concepts (CMPT432) at the University of Saskatchewan. This project is very academic in nature, and is not intended to be production quality code. Many times during the development of this OS we ran into problems with the hardware documentation for the Raspberri Pi, and had to figure out a lot things on our own. For this reason I believe this repository could have genuine value to the public, hence why I have not made it private.  

Some of the files in this project are the property of Alex Chadwick and were sourced from his Baking Pi tutorial series; we do not claim these files to be our own. However, the majority of the operating system was written by our project group and labeled accordingly.
