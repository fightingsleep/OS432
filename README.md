OS432
=====
This is a simple operating system designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (Model B). It was a class project for CMPT 432 at the University of Saskatchewan. Some of the files in this project are the property of Alex Chadwick and were sourced from his Baking Pi tutorial series; we do not claim these files to be our own. However, the majority of the operating system was written by our project group and labeled accordingly.
