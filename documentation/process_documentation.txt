Creating a process

1.gets a free pid
2.initializers program counter (for a general process it will launch the
  new_process() function, which will jump to the the function pointer defined 
  in register r6 the next time the process is scheduled
3.initializes heap
4.initializes stack
5.adds to list of callers children
6.adds to list of current processes

Process Structure:

	pid: process id = 1
	ppid: process id of parent = 0
	program_counter: address of next line of code to execute
	process_heap: data memory for this process
	  address: adderss of start location
	  size: definition of lingth of heap
	  next: currently NULL
	process_space_base: same as heap address for
	stack_pointer: address of top of stack 
	state: current state of process, starts as active
	children: list of child processes
	message_queue: list of messages

Master Process:
This is the default process that will be started once the pi is powered on.
It is currently acting as a sort of "shell" for the operating system.
It sends a promp to the console, then requests the next line input.
it uses this line as a command and if it is defined creates a process according
to that command.

Console Process:
recieves messages from other processes, and performs IO tasks for them.
if it is a print request it will print the string onto the screen, if it is a 
read request, it will get a line of keyboard input and send the line to the 
process.

Scheduling Processes:
The scheduler is currently a very simple implementation
it takes the list of processes, puts the first process on the back of the list
and restores the context of the new first process

Restoring Context:
writen in assemply
essentially pops the entries off of the process' stack in the reverse order 
they were pushed, into the corresponding registers which will allow the 
process to continue where it was interrupted
