Syscalls Documentation

All system calls are are outlined in user_syscalls.h, and are partially
implemented in user_syscalls.c. This file contains inline assembly which sets
the appropriate registers and makes the SVC call. The system level functions
that execute the system calls are located in various files depending on the
system call type (ipc_syscalls.c, process_syscalls.c, memory_syscalls.c,
misc_syscalls.c). The internal system call function array is initalized in
syscalls_init.c, and the system call numbers are defined in syscalls.h.
