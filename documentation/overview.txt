Our critical path:

We wanted to make sure that we had an operating system that could make user
processes, schedule these processes in some manner, output something to the
screen, and take some kind of user input. In order to achieve this we needed
basic memory management, context switching, a clock interrupt, interrupt
handling, and SVC handling (for syscalls).

What would be nice to have:

- Process / memory protection so that processes could only access their
allocated memory, and couldn't wipe out other processes if something went
wrong. This would involve programming the MMU and having some kind of paged
memory.

- Basic IPC primitives for coordination and message passing

- A scheduling algorithm beyond basic round robin

What we accomplished:

- Basic memory management (kmalloc, malloc)

- User process creation through our system call osc_create_process()

- A working context switcher

- A simple round robin scheduler

- A clock interrupt

- Screen output

- Keyboard input (although buggy)

- Basic IPC primitives (although buggy)

- A reasonable number of system calls for user programs to use

- A basic shell to launch processes from
